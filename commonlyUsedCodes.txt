I see 3 options :

Looping through object.bl_rna.properties.items() (I think this is the preferred way since this is supported by the API)

Looping through dir(object), which is the python way so you might break things if you try to use these attributes if they are not exposed to bl_rna.

Looking in the official documentation, which at least gives examples and explanations about each attribute.

import bpy

obj = bpy.context.object    

print('Using bl_rna :\n')

for prop, value in obj.bl_rna.properties.items():

   print(prop, value)        

print('\nUsing dir(object) :\n')

for attr in dir(obj):

    print(str(attr), getattr(obj, attr))
